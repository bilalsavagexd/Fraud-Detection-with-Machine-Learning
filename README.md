# Fraud-Detection-with-Machine-Learning

## Technologies Used

- Streamlit: For building the web app interface.

- Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms.

- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

- Plotly: For data visualization.

- XGBoost: For advanced gradient boosting models.

This app leverages the **Groq API** to enhance inference speed and efficiency. The models were pre-trained using traditional machine learning libraries like Scikit-Learn and XGBoost, but for deploying and running predictions at scale, the Groq API provides acceleration and optimized performance. This integration ensures fast real-time predictions, making the app suitable for larger datasets and production environments.
